**this file should not be turned in, its just for us to keep track of some stuff**

## Questions yet to ask
1. we are allowed to make a console application. But that would mean its tied to the program itself, meaning there are no http requests and stuff.
So like... why do we get all this stuff about http requests in the lessons when we are not even doing anything with it. Or are we supose to do something with it  
In other words, since there is no front/back-end, its all just 1 big block of code. meaning that there is not really 2 shells of validation (front and back). 
so validation that we give to the user will also automaticly become the backend validation
2. clearing the console. are we allowed to do that using `os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear')`
