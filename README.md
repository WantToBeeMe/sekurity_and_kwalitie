**this file should not be turned in, its just for us to keep track of some stuff**

## Questions yet to ask
1. we are allowed to make a console application. But that would mean its tied to the program itself, meaning there are no http requests and stuff.
So like... why do we get all this stuff about http requests in the lessons when we are not even doing anything with it. Or are we supose to do something with it
